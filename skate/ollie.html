                    <p>Disclaimer: I skate in regular stance, which means I skate with my left foot forward. If that doesn’t feel comfortable that means you are most likely goofy-footed. For those people, just mirror what I describe. So if I say my left foot, think of your right foot instead.
                    Step 1:
                    Position your body so that your shoulders are in line with your skateboard.
                    
                    Step 2:
                    Put your left foot just behind or on top of the four bolts that anchor your trucks onto your skateboard. 
                    
                    Step 3:
                    Put your right foot on the tail of the skateboard. In other words, put it on the back most raised portion of the skateboard.
                    
                    Step 4:
                    While jumping push down the tail of the board with your right foot so that it hits the ground.
                    
                    Step 4½: 
                    As soon as you complete step 4 begin sliding your left foot up the board until you reach the nose. After this prepare to land.
                    
                    Step 5:
                    Land and roll away!
