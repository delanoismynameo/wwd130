        [Welcome all who are learning how to skateboard! Have you ever wanted to learn to skateboard but had no teacher? Thanks to modern technology I can assist in your Goal to skateboard well! On this website, our goal is to teach you how to ollie and kickflip! I’m sure you’ve seen skateboarders in your neighborhood or around your town/ city. With a bit of practice, you will be able to shred anywhere you go. As long as there is smooth, solid ground! On this home page, you will find links to the Ollie and Kickflip sub-pages, as well as a link to my Instagram. On Instagram, I often post skateboarding videos! Feel free to follow me on Instagram to stay up to date with the latest things going on in my life! 

        I’m sure you are wondering how expensive this service is. Believe it or not, this is a free service. It is hosted here on the World Wide Web for anyone to access! You can support me by following my Instagram and staying up to date with me there!
        
        While learning how to skate I suggest either going to a skatepark or finding a place that has smooth ground. That ground will become your friend very quickly. Expect to fall often, It’s just something that comes with being a skater! Embrace it!
        
        Here is a link to the Ollie tutorial page. Make sure to feel comfortable riding on your board before attempting this trick! 
        
        Here is the link to the Kickflip tutorial page! I suggest attempting the Kickflip after you are comfortable with the Ollie

      <h3>[Ollie]</h3>
      <p>
        [Disclaimer: I skate in regular stance, which means I skate with my left foot forward. If that doesn’t feel comfortable that means you are most likely goofy-footed. For those people, just mirror what I describe. So if I say my left foot, think of your right foot instead.
        Step 1:
        Position your body so that your shoulders are in line with your skateboard.
        
        Step 2:
        Put your left foot just behind or on top of the four bolts that anchor your trucks onto your skateboard. 
        
        Step 3:
        Put your right foot on the tail of the skateboard. In other words, put it on the back most raised portion of the skateboard.
        
        Step 4:
        While jumping push down the tail of the board with your right foot so that it hits the ground.
        
        Step 4½: 
        As soon as you complete step 4 begin sliding your left foot up the board until you reach the nose. After this prepare to land.
        
        Step 5:
        Land and roll away!
        You Successfully Ollied!

        Wait for the board to flip a full 360 degrees then catch the board with your right foot and prepare to land.

        Land and roll away!
        
        You are so cool! You can Kickflip now!
