                    <p>Disclaimer: I skate in regular stance, which means I skate with my left foot forward. If that doesn’t feel comfortable that means you are most likely goofy-footed. For those people, just mirror what I describe. So if I say my left foot, think of your right foot instead.

                        Step 1:
                        Position your body so that your shoulders are in line with your skateboard.
                        
                        Step 2:
                        Put your left foot just behind the four bolts that anchor your trucks onto your skateboard. 
                        
                        Step 3:
                        Put your right foot on the tail of the skateboard. In other words, put it on the back most raised portion of the skateboard.
                        
                        Step 4:
                        While jumping push down the tail of the board with your right foot so that it hits the ground.
                        
                        Step 4½: 
                        As soon as you complete step 4 flick your left foot off the heel side of the board.
                        
                        Step 5:
                        Wait for the board to flip a full 360 degrees then catch the board with your right foot and prepare to land.
                        
                        Step 6:
                        Land and roll away!
                        
                        You are so cool! You can Kickflip now!
